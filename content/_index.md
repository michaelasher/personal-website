description: I'm an experimental psychologist whose research bridges the motivation and cognitive sciences. In this intersectional space, I examine the relationship between instruction, motivation, and learning, seeking to understand how educators can help students develop academic interests, persist in academic settings, and reach their potential. To date, most of my work has taken place in the context of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.
