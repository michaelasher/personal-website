description: I am an experimental psychologist studying how instructors can motivate students to engage and persist in academic environments. By combining tools from social psychology and cognitive science and integrating them into curricula and educational technology, I aim to develop theory-based interventions that are easy to adopt, that challenge studentsâ€™ stubborn and self-limiting beliefs about academic ability and the value of education, and that foster sustained engagement with academic content over time.
